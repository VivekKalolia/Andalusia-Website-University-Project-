        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <h3>
          What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of
          structure did you choose to implement?
        </h3>
        <p>I have created the Andalusia Training Centre website to foster engagement and learning through intuitive and enriching user experience. Our site is designed to connect learners, students, teachers, hobbyists and the community through a variety of programs, events and workshops.</p>

The homepage serves as an entry point, providing an overview of Andalusia Training Centre's purpose, featuring the "About" section which gives a short summary of the history of the centre's opening, as well as the scope of the students we have managed to provide education to.</p>
        <p>Visitors can delve deeper through dedicated pages, such as "Courses" Page which showcases the different range of courses we provide, as well as the "About" Page, which provides a brief overview, articulating the community's foundational objectives and mission. This page also features a Gallery, where visitors can look through different pictures of the organisation and its events.</p>
        <p>At its core, Andalusia Training Centre mirrors the changing world of educational careers, creating a space where learning, teaching and community engagement come together.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <div class="question-answer">
        <h2>Inspiration:</h2>
        <h3>
          State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g.
          guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs).
        </h3>
        <p>The design and development of the Andalusia Training Centre's website were guided by a few essential inspirations:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <span>Fueled by Personal Passion</span>: My own love for design is the heartbeat of this project. It's personal. Every late night tweaking the layout, every moment spent selecting the perfect font and color combinations, it's all been a labor of love. This website isn't just a project; it's a piece of me, a bridge between my passion for design and my eagerness to share knowledge with like-minded learners.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank"><span>Dribbble</span></a>: Dribbble has been a constant source of inspiration for me when it came to the website design. There’s this incredible design for an online educational platform on Dribbble that just captures the imagination: <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/22149360-Courseco-Online-Education-Website" target="_blank"><span>Dribbble Website Inspiration</span></a>. It blends vibrant colors with simple, direct messaging – exactly the kind of vibe I envisioned for Andalusia Training Centre's website. This design reminds me that educational websites don’t have to be bland; they can pop with energy and creativity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://awwwards.com/" target="_blank"><span>Awwwards</span></a>: A big source of ideas, Awwwards is a leading site for showcasing top-notch web design and development. It’s known for highlighting websites that stand out because they're very creative, easy to use, and bring something new to the table. This recognition inspired a lot of the Andalusia Training Centre's website. By exploring Awwwards, I picked up on the newest design trends and interesting ways to interact with users online. This insight helped improve the look and functionality of their site, making it more appealing and user-friendly. Awwwards played a crucial role in guiding Andalusia Training Centre towards excellence, helping me create a website that truly shines in offering educational courses. One of the websites from Awwwards: <span><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/elearning-crafto-html5-template" target="_blank">Awwwards Website Inspiration</a></span>, inspired me to design buttons with curved borders, and also gave me general ideas for the navigation bar links.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 3 -->
      <div class="question-answer">
        <h2>Accessibility:</h2>
        <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <span>Semantic HTML Structure</span>: Throughout the website, I utilized semantic HTML elements to structure the content. This approach to semantic markup guarantees that the information is presented in a logical manner, enhancing its clarity for users and accessibility devices alike. Incorporating elements like <span>&lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;,</span> and <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span>, improves the site's navigability and understandability by establishing a coherent and significant structure for the content, thereby enhancing accessibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Responsiveness</span>: The Andalusia Training Centre's website is crafted to seamlessly be responsive and adjust across various screen dimensions and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience. By employing media queries, I have preserved the site's aesthetic appeal and functionality across different platforms. Additionally, the implementation of flexible layout strategies, including flexbox and percentage-based widths, further enhances the site's ability to adapt to any viewing environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Image Accessibility Enhancement</span>: To ensure the Andalusia Training Centre's website is accessible to everyone, including users with visual impairments, all images are equipped with descriptive <span>alt</span> attributes. This enables screen readers to effectively interpret and convey the purpose of each image, enriching the browsing experience for users who rely on assistive technology. Additionally, this also helps to show preview texts in instances where images fail to load on the website. This careful focus highlights my dedication to making the website welcoming for everyone and meeting web accessibility guidelines, making the website more navigable and comprehensible for a diverse audience.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 4 -->
      <div class="question-answer">
        <h2>Usability:</h2>
        <h3>
          State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.
        </h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <span>Clear Navigation</span>: I have designed the Andalusia Training Centre's website navigation to be straightforward and user-friendly. The primary menu (navigation bar) is strategically positioned for easy visibility, and each menu item (or, nav-item), including <span>Home, Courses, About, Events,</span> and <span>Contact</span>, is clearly labeled to guide users effortlessly to the information they seek, whether they want to know more about the organisation or if they want to know the address of the organisation. For smaller screens, a mobile-responsive menu ensures that the site remains easy to use on any device. Lastly, I have introduced a feature that highlights the active page in the navigation bar by bolding the text (green bolded text, in my case). This visually indicates to users which section of the site they are currently viewing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Unified Design and Structure</span>: The website’s usability is further enhanced by a uniform design and layout. A cohesive look is achieved through standardized typography, color schemes (in my case, mostly blue and green), and interactive elements like buttons and links. This consistency aids users in quickly recognizing navigational features, fostering a comfortable and confident user experience as they interact with the Andalusia Training Centre’s online presence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Dynamic Currency Conversion (On Cards - Courses Page)</span>: To cater to our local audience, the Andalusia Training Centre's website features an interactive and dynamic pricing button on the course cards (On "Courses" Page). With a simple hover over the price button, the cost is automatically converted from a widely recognized currency (USD) to Tanzanian Shillings, offering immediate and localized pricing for our local visitors. This function not only simplifies the decision-making process for potential local students by presenting costs in their native currency, but also retains the convenience for international users by initially displaying prices in USD, thus enhancing the site's global usability.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 5 -->
      <div class="question-answer">
        <h2>Learning:</h2>
        <h3>
          State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How
          did you achieve that?
        </h3>
        <p>I have learnt a lot of concepts during the creation of the website. Some of the main lessons include:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <span>Customization of Bootstrap Framework</span>: During the process of developing the Andalusia Training Centre's website, I dove deep into Bootstrap to ensure the site was both responsive and engaging. My learning path involved absorbing the best practices from YouTube tutorials as well as University lectures, enabling me to effectively utilize Bootstrap's responsive frameworks and components. However, understanding that a unique user experience is key, I have customized Bootstrap's templates, infusing my own design elements to go beyond the basics. This customization allowed me to balance the framework's robust structure with a personalized touch. This approach ensured the website achieved a balance between professional functionality and distinct visual identity, making the learning experience both enriching and essential for the project’s success.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Advanced JavaScript for dynamics</span>: In enhancing the user experience of the website, I learned about advanced JavaScript using resources like YouTube, to create dynamic scroll-reveal effects. This technique involves programming specific sections of the website to become visible only as the user scrolls down, adding an engaging layer of interactivity. By listening for scroll events on the window, I learned how to strategically apply an "active" class to elements marked with the ".reveal-scroll" class. This not only enriches the visual experience but also guides visitors' attention to important content at just the right moment. I also implemented an image slider, where the user can press buttons to navigate through various pictures. The process of integrating these effects deepened my understanding of JavaScript and its powerful capability to transform static web pages into lively, interactive experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>CSS Box Model</span>: Exploring the fundamentals of web design, I learned about the CSS box model, a crucial concept that defines how elements are laid out and interact within their boundaries on a webpage. This understanding was pivotal in crafting layouts that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally robust. To deepen my grasp of this essential framework, I turned to the comprehensive documentation provided by MDN Web Docs - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model" target="_blank"><span>CSS Box Model (MDN Web Docs)</span></a>. The insights gained from these resources were instrumental in enabling me to precisely control padding, borders, margins, and the overall spacing around elements, ensuring that each component on the website was meticulously placed for optimal user experience. This foundational knowledge not only enhanced my design capabilities but also enriched my skill set, allowing for more intuitive and sophisticated website development.

        </ol>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 6 -->
      <div class="question-answer">
        <h2>Evaluation I:</h2>
        <h3>
          What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful?
          Why?
        </h3>
        <p>I think I was successful in the following implementations on my website:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <span>The use of Box Model and Semantic Tags</span>: My design strategy encompassed the strategic application of the CSS box model alongside semantic HTML elements, ensuring that related content was neatly grouped within appropriate containers. This method fostered a website layout that is both orderly and accessible, significantly improving visual coherence and the overall user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Designing the overall Website Appearance</span>: In developing the website, I placed a strong emphasis on the visual design, ensuring that the color scheme harmonized with the organization's logo to establish a consistent and appealing brand identity. By carefully implementing the correct designs and aiming for modern minimalism, I achieved a website that is easily navigable and yet visually captivating. The thoughtful consideration of color, typography, and layout culminated in an aesthetic that not only elevates the user experience but also strengthens the site's overall look and feel, mirroring the professionalism and essence of the Andalusia Training Centre.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Organizing Content into appropriate Design Elements</span>: I think I successfully managed to organize the services offered by the organisation into clearly defined sections, such as cards, articles, vision, mission, and goal sections, as well as events and workshops among others. By employing these structured design elements, each service is highlighted in its own space, making information easily accessible and understandable for the end users. This strategic layout not only enhances the visual appeal of the website but also ensures that the content is presented in a well-structured, logical and engaging manner.

        <h2>Appendices:</h2>
        <h3>Site map (if useful), wireframes and mock-ups</h3>
        <h2>Wireframes:</h2>
        <p>Before initiating my website project, I thoroughly crafted detailed wireframes to guide its development. Presented below, are the initial sketches that laid the foundation for my design plans:</p>
        <div class="wireframes">
          <img src="images/wireframes/home-page.png" alt="Home Page Wireframe">
          <img src="images/wireframes/courses-page.png" alt="Courses Page Wireframe">

          <img src="images/wireframes/contact-page.png" alt="Contact Page Wireframe">
        </div>

        <h2>Mockups:</h2>
        <p>I used <span>Canva</span> to design a homepage mockup, setting the overall design direction without creating mockups for all pages. This process revealed my preference for a flexible design workflow, emphasizing coding and testing over rigidly following a predetermined layout.<p>
